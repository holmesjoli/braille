# Braille

## Topic
For this project, I visualized the Braille language. I was interested in learning how Braille works as a system like any other language. Understanding how people use everyday assistive technologies helps strengthen my practice as a designer. 
## Motivation
Accessibility is a vast but often neglected topic in design work. Due to the popularization of universal design, an easy trap that designers will often fall into is to believe they are designing for everyone. However, design will never afford users universally. For example, I created this visualization on the web in English. My design disaffords non-English speakers and users without internet access.
I chose this topic because accessibility in information visualization is an underdeveloped knowledge area. As a design student studying visualization for the web, color-blindness is the most addressed accessibility topic. Color-blindness affects 8.0% of men and 0.5% of women, approximately 300 million people [^1]. Beyond this, accessibility in visualization for the web goes most unaddressed. While it’s helpful to be aware of color-blindness, visual impairment affects 2.2 billion people more generally [^2]. A person who has a visual impairment may rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader to interact with the web. Although researchers initially designed screen readers to assist people with low vision, they have a diverse group of users, including older people with changing abilities and cognitive and learning disabilities. They can also help people whose ability has changed temporarily or situationally, such as someone with a broken arm or sitting in bright sunlight [^3].
## Data
For this project, all of my data were hand-collected. The most important part of the data collection process was an interview I conducted with my friend Megan who has blindness. Braille is a tactile language that is learned and used through embodied experience. Talking with Megan about their experience using Braille is central to this project because there is an inherent tension in the visual representation of a system that is experienced tactilely and fundamentally cannot be experienced visually, for whom this topic is most pertinent. Additionally, I collected matrix positioning and spacing information so that the visual cells can accurately represent physical Braille cells.

### Megan Interview

* I was not a fan of Braille. I fought against learning Braille because it’s ancient and there’s lots of advanced technology which can read signs and pictures.
* It’s not an easy thing to learn because you a literally learning a new language. Most people who are visual see the word and pronounce the word. With Braille you can only feel the word.
* You find systems.
* Braille is always going to be there when computers are not.
* Braille cell contains a-z. It is a dot numbering system that you have to program into your brain. Once you can spell out words you more to contracted. It’s about learning these dot positions. The braille cell is no bigger than the tip of your finger. Most people with sensory issues don’t get to learn braille.
* Larger chain restaurants will sometimes have Braille menus.
Contracted is almost like shorthand.
* Harder without vision. You can hear them repeat the dot positions. You can feel them with your hand. There’s nothing like physically seeming something. I’m having to visualize what I think it may look like and then process what my brain says it looks like.
* Has not changed since it was invented.
* Eyes folder on iPhone.
    * Be my eyes
    * Seeing AI
        * Color
        * Currency
        * Read a letter
