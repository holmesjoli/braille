            <p>Braille is a notational system developed for people with blindness, deafblindness, and low vision in the early 1800s by Frenchman Louis Braille.</p>
            <p>Notational systems represent the sounds or words of a language. In the case of Braille, the notational system is tactile instead of visual. Assistive technologies are associated with accessibility. However, while Braille does assist many in the visually impaired community, like any technology it isn't accessible to the entire community. </p>
            <blockquote>
                Megan: Braille cell contains a-z. It is a dot numbering system that you have to program into your brain. It's about memorizing dot positions, because the braille cell is no bigger than the tip of your finger. Because it's tactile though, people with sensory issues may find it more challening to learn Braille.

            <p><em>A quick note:</em> The following webpage visualizes the notational system of Braille. The irony of this is not lost on me as the author and I have tried to include many features that will make this page accessible to people with vision impairment. As someone who has not needed to rely on Braille as an assistive technology, I felt it it would be insensitive to research this topic without including input from those who are regular users of Braille. I relied on the knowledge of a friend of mine, Megan, who has a visual impairment.</p>
