    <div class="intro">

            <p>Braille is a notational system developed for people with blindness, deafblindness, and low vision. Notational systems represent the sounds or words of a language. In the case of Braille, the notational system is interpreted by the user tactilely instead of visually. While, Frenchman Louis Braille is credited with the development in the early 1800s, Braille was not the first touch-based reading system.</p>
            <p>In the late 1900s,  Frenchman Valentine Hauy embossed the roman letters in common texts. However, the reliance on typographic composition made the system challenging to learn and resulted in very low literacy among people with low vision. The system which led to the development of Braille was developed by artillery captain Charles Barbier de la Serre in 1822. The code that Barbier developed was known as night writing and developed as a military technology to give soliders the ability to be able to communicate silently and without a light source at night. Barbier's system was phonetic, relied on a 12-dot pattern which did not easily fit under a finger tip pad.</p>
            <p>Since Louis Braille's redesign, the language not changed drastically. Since the 1950s there have been efforts to standardize the language by UNESCO. In 2005, the released a statement saying the Braille system is a <i>"vital language of communication, as legitimate as all other languages in the world."</i></p>

The irony of this is not lost on me as the author and I have tried to include many features that will make this page accessible to people with vision impairment. As someone who has not needed to rely on Braille as an assistive technology, I felt it it would be insensitive to research this topic without including input from those who are regular users of Braille. I relied on the knowledge of a friend of mine, Megan, who has a visual impairment.</p>
